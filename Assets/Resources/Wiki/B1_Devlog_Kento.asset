  Title: 'A forgotten sorcerer, a remembered dream. '
  Subtitle: Kento
  Content: "\tAfter a prolonged stay in my imagination, <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark>
    now\u2026 exists. In a rudimentary form, at least. Eren and I have elected it
    as our thesis project for the year. There is something innately surreal about
    the work of creating, as distinct from the precursor act of imagining. Once a
    work goes from an idea - the stuff of ether - to material, to something others
    can touch and look at and judge, it\u2019s easy to forget you can no longer change
    it with a thought. It\u2019s not yours anymore, really.\r\n\r\n\tBy serendipity
    (or irony, as the case may be), the story I have outlined is related to that
    idea. Eren - who routinely tries and fails to keep me grounded - has reminded
    me that we ought to be cautious with how big we dream. We are only a student
    game. In my opinion nobody who plays <mark=#ffff00aa>Trismegistus</mark> will
    care where it came from if it isn\u2019t a <b>good</b> game. I will bleed on
    my canvas if I have to.\r\n\r\n\tI should refocus before I go on another rant.
    The start of the plot as I have imagined it is that our protagonist is an amnesiac
    <mark=#ffff00aa>sorcerer</mark> waking up in a world that has passed him by,
    and forgotten the magic of old. The opening section sees them escaping from a
    maze, at the center of which they have been imprisoned. They will then go on
    to face the former gods of their world and confront the shadows of their past.\r\n\r\n\tTo
    be brief, I will simply say that the arc of the story involves discovering our
    lead character is less innocent than we\u2019ve been led to believe. I\u2019ve
    drawn inspiration from Planescape: Torment here, a game that leverages the bias
    of the player to sympathize with their avatar, and then complicates that relationship.\r\n\r\n\tOur
    advisor doesn\u2019t see the vision, unfortunately. I had to simplify the idea
    for her. I think the larger point I\u2019m trying to make about the misuse of
    power went over her head, but we won her over eventually. Her suggestion was
    that we bring on a third member to ease the workload: Rose. \r\n\r\n\tRose\u2019s
    talent isn\u2019t in question, but I don\u2019t know yet if her artistic priorities
    are the same as ours. She did contribute a genuinely innovative piece of system
    design: a <mark=#ffff00aa>modular</mark> magic system. I\u2019ve begun drafting
    puzzles to put it through its paces and test its limitations. We\u2019ll see
    whether or not the system affords us the narrative design space we need.\r\n\r\n\tP.S:
    Threw a wall into Eren\u2019s test level that can only be destroyed with \u201CBeam\u201D
    shaped spells. Just testing to make sure the collider and tag code is working.
    I\u2019ve named the build <mark=#ffff00aa>Aglaea</mark>, after one of the three
    Greek charities. \r\n"
