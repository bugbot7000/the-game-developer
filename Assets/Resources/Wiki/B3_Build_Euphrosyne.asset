  Title: Euphrosyne
  Subtitle: Eren
  Content: "I finally combined Rose's minotaur model with Kento's level design and
    the result looks great! The particle system Rose designed really makes the spells
    pop hehe We also put in the new interface for spells where you can select the
    spell of a shape\nThe save and load system was causing too much issues so we
    had to remove it for now sadly \r\nKento mentioned that this title stood for
    merriment but muttered something ironic about the last charity ending up on this
    build. Not sure what that was about\r"
