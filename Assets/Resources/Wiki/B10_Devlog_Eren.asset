  Content: "- So I had a free trial of Death last week\r\n- Just a quick 30 minute
    session you know\r\n- Special deal for new customers \r\n- When I finally got
    back home I saw that Mooncake decided to leave her own special dev log\r\n- I\u2019m
    keeping it in because it\u2019s funny and quite frankly I could use a little
    whimsy in my life right now since I fucking passed out in the middle of an in
    person <mark=#ffff00aa>interview</mark>\r\n- The nurse was really worried about
    me at first \r\n- But once I told him about my crazy <mark=#ffff00aa>workflow</mark>
    and my headaches and my continuing to work even though I know I\u2019m really
    pushing myself way too hard he just rolled his eyes at me \r\n- Told me to listen
    to my body and that I\u2019m lucky I\u2019m so young \r\n- So yeah I\u2019m mostly
    totally fine \r\n- I just need to hydrator dehydrate no that\u2019s not what
    I meant \r\n- Hydrate or die-drate \r\n- And actually sleep\r\n- Silver lining
    though I finally managed to fix that stupid <mark=#ffff00aa>glitch</mark>\r\n-
    Tony from Toonity was actually a big help\r\n- I would sneak him in the credits
    as a special thanks if it weren\u2019t for the bad news \r\n- Which is that I
    really don\u2019t think this game is gonna happen anymore\r\n- While I was gone
    Kento and Rose decided to go scorched earth in the group chat\r\n- I\u2019m choosing
    to delete that from the server archive because it was really really bad and got
    very personal on both ends\r\n- I\u2019m super bummed out about it which sounds
    a bit anticlimactic to say but I just can\u2019t find the words\r\n- I\u2019m
    just really sad\r\n- I guess I just kind of maybe had a bit of a hunch that things
    were gonna end up like this\r\n- Especially without the guidance and structure
    of UCP\r\n- Kento and Rose are both great and they\u2019re more like each other
    than they think \r\n- I really think that there might have been a way that this
    all could have worked out\r\n- I keep thinking that maybe if I had only done
    this thing or that thing or some other thing we could\u2019ve all gotten along
    and held it together until the game is complete\r\n- I did notice Kento\u2019s
    failed <mark=#ffff00aa>Aventurine</mark> build from shortly before my free death
    trial and went to see if it was an easy fix\r\n- Turns out he called the wrong
    function and the game was getting stuck in a death loop\r\n- It also has some
    of Kento\u2019s cryptic KitHub commits in there\n- Like, there's one that just
    says \"space 123 space 1 shift shift\"?\r\n- I basically included everything
    as long as it didn\u2019t break the game\r\n- I don\u2019t really know the full
    extent of what\u2019s in there anymore and I really can\u2019t be bothered to
    comb through Kento\u2019s messy code any further to see what he added\n- The
    build is called <mark=#ffff00aa>Nephrite</mark>\r\n- In the meantime this dead
    end job search and my health are really putting things into perspective for me\r\n-
    I suppose it\u2019s time to grow up and get a real person job \r\n- Mooncake\u2019s
    gotta eat after all\r"
