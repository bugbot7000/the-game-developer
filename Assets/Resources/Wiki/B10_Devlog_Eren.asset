  Content: "- So I had a free trial of Death last week\r\n- Just a quick 30 minute
    session you know\r\n- Special deal for new customers \r\n- When I finally got
    back home I saw that Mooncake decided to leave her own special dev log\r\n- I\u2019m
    keeping it in because it\u2019s funny and quite frankly I could use a little
    whimsy in my life right now since I fucking passed out in the middle of an in
    person <mark=#ffff00aa>interview</mark>\r\n- The nurse was really worried about
    me at first \r\n- But once I told him about my crazy <mark=#ffff00aa>workflow</mark>
    and my headaches and my continuing to work even though I know I\u2019m really
    pushing myself way too hard he just rolled his eyes at me \r\n- Told me to listen
    to my body and that I\u2019m lucky I\u2019m so young \r\n- So yeah I\u2019m mostly
    totally fine \r\n- I just need to hydrator dehydrate no that\u2019s not what
    I meant \r\n- Hydrate or die-drate \r\n- And actually sleep\r\n- Silver lining
    though I finally managed to fix that stupid <mark=#ffff00aa>glitch</mark>\r\n-
    Tony from Toonity was actually a big help\r\n- I would sneak him in the credits
    as a special thanks if it weren\u2019t for the bad news \r\n- Which is that I
    really don\u2019t think this game is gonna happen anymore\r\n- While I was gone
    Kento and Rose decided to go scorched earth in the group chat\r\n- I\u2019m choosing
    not to archive that because it was really really bad and got very personal on
    both ends\r\n- I\u2019m super bummed out about it which sounds a bit anticlimactic
    to say but I just can\u2019t find the words\r\n- I\u2019m just really sad\r\n-
    I guess I just kind of maybe had a bit of a hunch that things were gonna end
    up like this\r\n- Especially without the guidance and structure of UCP\r\n- Kento
    and Rose are both great and they\u2019re more like each other than they think
    \r\n- I really think that there might have been a way that this all could have
    worked out\r\n- I keep thinking that maybe if I had only done this thing or that
    thing or some other thing we could\u2019ve all gotten along and held it together
    until the game is complete\r\n- I did notice Kento\u2019s failed <mark=#ffff00aa>Aventurine</mark>
    build from shortly before my free death trial and went to see if it was an easy
    fix\r\n- Turns out he called the wrong function and the game was getting stuck
    in a death loop\r\n- It also has some of Kento\u2019s cryptic KitHub commits
    in there\r\n- I basically included everything as long as it didn\u2019t break
    the game\r\n- I don\u2019t really know the full extent of what\u2019s in there
    anymore and I really can\u2019t be bothered to comb through Kento\u2019s messy
    code any further to see what he added\n- The build is called <mark=#ffff00aa>Nephrite</mark>\r\n-
    In the meantime this dead end job search and my health are really putting things
    into perspective for me\r\n- I suppose it\u2019s time to grow up and get a real
    person job \r\n- Mooncake\u2019s gotta eat after all\r"
