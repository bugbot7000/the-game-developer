  Title: So, this is the end.
  Subtitle: Kento
  Content: "\tI thought about deleting <mark=#ffff00aa>Ritual</mark> from the game.
    Just because\u2026 fuck it, ya know? Might feel good to smash the canvas. But
    I couldn\u2019t do it. I hovered right over the recycle bin, but I couldn\u2019t
    let it drop. I hid it behind a convoluted keyboard shortcut, not even Eren knows
    it\u2019s there; it\u2019s easy to miss on a commit, and it looks like he ended
    up fixing my code and making one last build called <mark=#ffff00aa>Nephrite</mark>.
    I should thank him for that. \n\r\n\tNot sure what I\u2019m doing with myself
    now. Still bad at every <mark=#ffff00aa>interview</mark> I go to. I\u2019m not
    a herd animal, never have been. \n\r\n\tBut who knows? Maybe I\u2019ll get kicked
    out of the house and stuck as a wage slave, have a couple kids I can pass all
    my mediocrity down to, and spend the rest of my life pretending to fit in. It
    would probably make my mom think I was happy, since she measures happiness via
    checklist instead of actual <mark=#ffff00aa>enjoyment</mark>.\n\r\n\tI had a
    very close friendship with a girl named Fernanda in grade school. Nicest kid
    I\u2019d ever met. She needed crutches to get around, so she couldn\u2019t play
    any games where you needed to run. One time during recess when most of the other
    kids were playing some variant of tag. The rules were that if you managed to
    run all the way around the big track field and then back inside the school, you
    were safe.\n\r\n\tThere was this one kid, Dean, who was maybe a head taller than
    everyone else. The others usually went along with whatever he said. And that
    day he said \u2018the crippled girl\u2019 couldn\u2019t play. So I stood in front
    of the school entrance and pushed every kid who got close. I got a bloody nose
    and detention for my trouble. I think Dean got a lecture.\n\r\n\tThat was the
    first time my mom said I act like it\u2019s \u2018me against the world.\u2019
    The one good thing my dad ever did was say she was wrong that day. I trusted
    him back then. I trusted him, Fernanda, and pretty much nobody else. Eventually
    Fernanda and I lost touch, and my dad lost interest in most things, me included.\n\r\n\tI
    sometimes wonder what my childhood would have been like if I made more friends.
    Believe it or not, I was pretty athletic in high school. My mom wanted me to
    join a sport, something team related.\n\r\n\tI didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t
    want to join the herd. \n\r\n\tI still don\u2019t.\r"
