  Title: So, this is the end.

  Content: "\tI thought about deleting <mark=#ffff00aa>Ritual</mark> from the game.
    Just because\u2026 fuck it, ya know? Might feel good to smash the canvas. But
    I couldn\u2019t do it. I hovered right over the recycle bin, but I couldn\u2019t
    let it drop. I hid it behind a convoluted keyboard shortcut, not even Eren knows
    it\u2019s there; it\u2019s easy to miss on the KitHub commit where I added the
    shortcut, and it looks like he ended up fixing my code and making one last build
    called <mark=#ffff00aa>Nephrite</mark>. I should thank him for that. \n\r\n\tNot
    sure what I\u2019m doing with myself now. Still bad at every <mark=#ffff00aa>interview</mark>
    I go to. I\u2019m not a herd animal, never have been. \n\r\n\tBut who knows?
    Maybe I\u2019ll get kicked out of the house and stuck as a wage slave, have a
    couple kids I can pass all my mediocrity down to, and spend the rest of my life
    pretending to fit in. It would probably make my mom think I was happy, since
    she measures happiness via checklist instead of actual <mark=#ffff00aa>enjoyment</mark>.\n\r\n\tI
    had a very close friendship with a girl named Fernanda in grade school. Nicest
    kid I\u2019d ever met. She needed crutches to get around, so she couldn\u2019t
    play any games where you needed to run. One time during recess when most of the
    other kids were playing some variant of tag. The rules were that if you managed
    to run all the way around the big track field and then back inside the school,
    you were safe.\n\r\n\tThere was this one kid, Dean, who was maybe a head taller
    than everyone else. The others usually went along with whatever he said. And
    that day he said \u2018the crippled girl\u2019 couldn\u2019t play. So I stood
    in front of the school entrance and pushed every kid who got close. I got a bloody
    nose and detention for my trouble. I think Dean got a lecture.\n\r\n\tThat was
    the first time my mom said I act like it\u2019s \u2018me against the world.\u2019
    The one good thing my dad ever did was say she was wrong that day. I trusted
    him back then. I trusted him, Fernanda, and pretty much nobody else. Eventually
    Fernanda and I lost touch, and my dad lost interest in most things, me included.\n\r\n\tI
    sometimes wonder what my childhood would have been like if I made more friends.
    Believe it or not, I was pretty athletic in high school. My mom wanted me to
    join a sport, something team related.\n\r\n\tI didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t
    want to join the herd. \n\r\n\tI still don\u2019t.\r"
