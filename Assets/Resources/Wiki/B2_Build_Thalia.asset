  Content: "In following with my established naming system, <mark=#ffff00aa>Thalia</mark>
    is the Greek Charity of abundance. \r\nEren is hard at work creating the logic
    for our first boss fight and still hasn\u2019t implemented much of Rose\u2019s
    existing art into the game (not that she had it done in time). \r\nIn the meantime
    I made a greybox of the level - just placeholder shapes. I\u2019m also messing
    around with the narration, which is giving me new ideas for the game\u2019s overarching
    story. \r\nControls are in the build when it\u2019s opened. \r"
