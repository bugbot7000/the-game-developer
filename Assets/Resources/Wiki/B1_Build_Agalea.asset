  Content: "So this build has the basic systems I've made to start developing the
    game. Kento named it after a minor goddess in Greek mythology. I think one of
    the Charities? \r\n\r\nControls: \r\nWASD or arrow keys to move through the <mark=#ffff00aa>maze</mark>.
    Well it's not really a maze right now but it'll get there\r\nJ to cast your currently
    prepared spell\r\nR to respawn\r\n\r\n(I\u2019ve added a wall in the build to
    test a potential way of solving puzzles. - Kento)\r"
