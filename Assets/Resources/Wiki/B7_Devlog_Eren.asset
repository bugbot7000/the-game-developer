  Title: Job and game struggles
  Subtitle: Eren
  Content: "- I think I\u2019m done looking for industry roles sigh\r\n- Dad always
    says to apply to everything because you never know\r\n- Subliminal said no the
    other week and I was pretty sad about that but looking back on it I guess I should
    have been grateful they at least said something\r\n- Caper Games (they make Momo
    Magick) posted a job listing for a junior programmer role recently and I was
    perfect for it \r\n- They wanted someone with a background in both fashion and
    programming since it\u2019s a fashion game so finally my weird major minor combination
    is relevant\r\n- And they also wanted someone who could talk to their Taiwanese
    branch since the main company is based in Hsinchu\r\n- On top of all that I was
    able to get a personal recommendation from a professor who knows someone at Caper
    Games since the career people at UCP said that like 60 percent of games jobs
    are done through referrals anyways \r\n- So yeah I was expecting at least an
    <mark=#ffff00aa>interview</mark> but they didn\u2019t even contact me at all.
    Not even a no thanks\r\n- After the referral, the oddly specific qualifications,
    all of it\r\n- Didn\u2019t even get an email\r\n- What\u2019s the point of applying
    to more general jobs if I can\u2019t even get the stuff that I\u2019m really
    really qualified for\r\n- The stress is just making my <mark=#ffff00aa>health</mark>
    worse since my headaches won\u2019t go away now\r\n- I guess I\u2019m just really
    burnt out on this whole triple A industry thing right now\r\n- Mooncake\u2019s
    gotta eat so I might start looking for something else soon \n- (mooncake_bruh_moment.png)\r\n-
    Oh yeah this was supposed to be a dev log\r\n- Kento blew up at Rose last week
    over the new <mark=#ffff00aa>Jade</mark> build which is honestly no surprise
    at this point\r\n- Rose started working at Revolt a few weeks ago so she was
    justified in pushing back on Kento just as hard\r\n- Which she did like really
    bad but to be completely honest she\u2019s the biggest bottleneck right now because
    I can\u2019t implement her assets if I don\u2019t have them\r\n- I can\u2019t
    help but feel that Rose is in the right here but her response to Kento really
    just escalated things\r\n- There\u2019s no way we\u2019ll finish this game without
    her though \r\n- She must have so little free time nowadays so I really appreciate
    it\r\n- I just wish that every time Kento picks a fight with her she wouldn\u2019t
    swing back twice as hard\r"
